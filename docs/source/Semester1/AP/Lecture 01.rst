Vectors: Components and Addition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Vectors are directional quantities possessing a magnitude and an angle, conventionally taken counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis. 

| Graphically, vectors can be added by joining the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. In graphical form, the equation :math:`\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}` can be represented as

| Sometimes, however, graphical vector addition can get very complicated. This is why we use the component method: 

| First, find the x and y components of the vectors you want to add. Consider the equation :math:`\vec{R} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}`.
| There are a few important things to remember:
*    Verify that your calculator is in the proper mode \(degrees or radians\).
*    Take the angles from the x-axis - and stick to this convention. This way, you won't have to change the formula used for finding the x and y components.
*    Cross-check the sign of the component. If the vector is in the negative x direction, make sure the x component is negative.
| Finally, add the components to get the resultant vector's component. :math:`\vec{R}` :sub:`x` :math:`= \vec{A}` :sub:`x` :math:`+ \vec{B}` :sub:`x`. The same formula works for y components.
| For the magnitude of the resultant, use the pythagorean theorem: :math:`\vert\vec{R}\vert = \sqrt{\vec{A}^2 + \vec{B}^2}`, which can be further expanded as :math:`\vert\vec{R}\vert = \sqrt (\, {\vec{A}_{\text{x}}^2 + \vec{A}_{\text{y}}^2 )\, + (\, \vec{B}_{\text{x}}^2 + \vec{B}_{\text{y}}^2 )\,`
