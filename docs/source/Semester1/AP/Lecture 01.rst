Vectors
^^^^^^^

| Vectors are directional quantities possessing a magnitude and an angle, conventionally taken counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis.
| Consider a Vector :math:`\vec{A}`. It has horizontal and vertical components represented by :math:`\vec{A}` :sub:`x` and :math:`\vec{A}` :sub:`y`, respectively.

| Head-to-Tail Rule:
|
| Graphically, vectors can be added by joining the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. In graphical form, the equation :math:`\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}` can be represented as

| In the case that the vector's heads or tails don't match up, the vectors can be shifted on the plane for the desired result.

| Negative Vectors:
| A negative vector is parallel, of equal magnitude and of opposite direction. :math:`\vec{A} = 5` is simply
