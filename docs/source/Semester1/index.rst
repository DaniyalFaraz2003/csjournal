| If you're a student from a new admission, here's some advice and general tips to know from the mistakes I've made, so you don't have to.

*    If you need to buy a new machine, get a laptop. If you don't have much money, get a used or refurbished laptop and put an SSD in it.
*    Buy a whiteboard so you can write down your weekly tasks and deadlines and then you can put it in the corner and wake up to it every day
*    Interact with people and find out more of who they are and what their skills are. You'll be surprised with the level of people that arrive to this institution from all sorts of places. Make sure you have someone you trust because the only thing standing between you and a bad grade is their ability to explain a concept to you (I still owe you for explaining the entire Islamic Studies syllabus to me 40 minutes before the sessional. If you're reading this, Thanks Zubair!).
*    You shouldn't worry, you shouldn't complain, and you shouldn't cry. The reason being, it doesn't help. Just breathe, relax, and focus. You got this. Make sure to drink plenty of water.
*    Aim for the highest that YOU can do. Don't compare yourself to others or else you will feel incredibly demotivated. Take the opportunity of a loss to instead learn and improve so you don't repeat those mistakes. In a lot of situations you will have done something correctly, but not in the way FAST wanted you to do it. Don't complain about it and don't fight it. Just try to understand it and adapt to it. If you think FAST is brutal, you haven't worked in customer service.
*    Don't be afraid or hesitant to ask seniors for help. They were where you are now. But also don't consider their words as truth. Sometimes they can screw you over or traditions can change over time. Just take it as advice.
