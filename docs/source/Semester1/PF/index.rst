| This site is currently going updates until the Semester finishes. Please refresh the page to make sure it's the latest version.

| On the right side of the page you'll find a table of sorts that, upon clicking any of the text there, will take you to that section of the page. The page is very long, it has the notes of the ENTIRE SEMESTER. Further organizing it wasn't possible, that's why it's like this.
| If you're after a specific topic then just press Ctrl-F (or if in browser, then 'Find in Page') to search for it.

| To avoid copyright issues with FAST, none of their material will be uploaded here. I can however reference info from it, and upload and link files that don't belong to them.
|

*    Ubuntu, version 20.04, installed via Dual Boot or Virtual Machine (They say it's not allowed but honestly a VM is better for most cases. It works perfectly fine and I use it. It's far far less of a hassle to install and takes less space)
