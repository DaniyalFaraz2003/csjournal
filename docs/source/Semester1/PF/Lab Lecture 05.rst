Lab Lecture 05
--------------

| Week 5.
| It was just more practice of Type Coercion. Read :ref:`s1-t007` for details. There was a specific problem called Problem 04 which we were told to leave for now as none of us could figure it out. We had to take the individual digits of a number and keep adding them until we got to a one digit answer, but the catch is that we're not allowed to use the MOD ``(%)`` operator to actually separate the digits.
| I'll write the answer here if I find it later.
