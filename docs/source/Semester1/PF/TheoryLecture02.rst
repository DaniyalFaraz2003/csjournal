Theory Lecture 02
-----------------

| Week 1.
| A lot of background information on what Fundamentals means and what Programming means, and then finally, Programming Fundamentals. Computer Organization is also important and then there was the history of Von-Neumann.

| There are three types of languages:
*    Machine Language: Only language machine actually understands. This is the 0's and 1's you see. Very cumbersome for humans but ALL languages are deconstructed to this level via something that translates them for the computer.
*    Assembly Language: 1's and 0's with letters. It's very very close to Machine Language but is readable by humans. You can program in it but it will test your patience like no other. But hey, Chris Sawyer got 30 Million Dollars for it since he made a game called RollerCoaster Tycoon. So if you have the guts, then go for it. The translator for Assembly Language is called the Instructor.
*    High Level Language: Way closer to Human Language. Uses Common Math operations, and converted either in real time with Interpretors, or after compiling all at once with Compilers. C++ is a Compiled language. Compiler languages are much faster than Interpreted languages but troubleshooting can be a massive hassle as, if one part of the code doesn't work, the entire thing drops.
