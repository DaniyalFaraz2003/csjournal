Things I wish I knew earlier
----------------------------

*    Practice typing speed. You will have a massive advantage which you'll need if you want to stay ahead in programming. If you're able to type without looking at the keyboard, then you're set.
*    For the first Sessionals, the other logic statements are easy to understand, but BITWISE requires a lot of practice. It may be easy to understand but there's a lot of situations that require you to think outside the box. Look up exercises and things you can do with BITWISE functions. Here's what we were asked in our first exams:
    *    Add two numbers using only BITWISE functions, without the use of IF statements and without the use of LOOPS
    *    Turn all bits to the right of the most significant bit into 1
    *    Find most significant bit of a number
    *    Turn all consecutive bits at the end of a number into 0's
    *    Input a position then flip a bit at that specific position
