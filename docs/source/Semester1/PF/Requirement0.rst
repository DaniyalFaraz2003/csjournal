Equipment Requirements
----------------------

| So before we can actually get started on Programming Fundamentals we're gonna need a few things. You can't be a mechanic without tools, and you can't be a programmer without a computer. You can try learning Programming on a phone or a tablet but it's just gonna be so much more of a hassle compared to just doing it the way you're supposed to do it. So, let's get started.
|
| Stuff to get:

*    Computer:

    | Any computer is fine, as long as it's not a phone or a tablet. It NEEDS to be running some form of Windows, or Linux. Either option is fine.
    | If you don't have a computer yet but want to make a purchase for it, then contact me via Discord (Woha #6430) and I can help out with making a proper decision. You can also just go to Tech channels and internet forums to figure things out on your own. Ultimately if your budget is low then your best option is a used computer with an SSD.

*    VisualStudioCode:

    | There are plenty of options but this one just has the most support and most people using it. It's the one I use personally (even though my university wants us to just use Ubuntu's GEdit, which is the equivalent of Notepad in Windows) and I highly recommend it. It's downloadable both for Windows and Ubuntu from their `Official Download Page <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_.
    | Once you install it, make sure to get the `Code Runner Addon <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner>`_ as well. VSCode is just a text editor, kind of like Microsoft Word. In professional environments you use something called an IDE to actually make the code run. But these are just beginner steps, so that addon is enough for now.

    Make sure to go into Settings, and to enable the setting to ``Run in Terminal``. Otherwise, Code-Runner won't be able to work with Inputs (you'll learn what those are later).

*    Keyboard:

    | Just make sure it's not broken and all the keys are fine. Programming is all about typing. Even individual letters being misplaced can cause everything to fail.

*    Pen and Paper:

    | Although I'll be explaining in my words how to do everything, you still have to make the effort of learning yourself. Take notes, try to revise stuff, and most importantly, keep practicing. 
    | The pen and paper are also important for flowchart and pseudocode practice, which we'll get to later.

.. note::

   Yes I do know that Online Compilers are a thing, but again, it just makes things unnecessarily complicated. Technically you can learn all of Programming just by reading a book and never even having a computer or even electricity, but it's just not practical. A hands on experience and above all, PRACTICE, is the best way to learn and be good at this.
