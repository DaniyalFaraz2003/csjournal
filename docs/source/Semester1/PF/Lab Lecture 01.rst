Lab Lecture 01
--------------

| Week 1.
| It was a lot of people there and a lot of noise but pay attention as EVERY SINGLE LAB CLASS for PF Lab is graded. You'll need a laptop or computer already. If you don't have one then you'll have to stay extra hours at FAST so you can use their labs. That might affect your situation with transport, but they don't care. You either do it or you don't get a grade. If you need a good machine for little cost, then get an old laptop and put an SSD in there.

| You learn Ubuntu in this class. The Terminal is the thing that you'll use the most. The commands to remember are:

*    ``mkdir name``: Makes new folder in current directory with name of ``name``
*    ``touch name.ext``: Makes new file in current directory with name of ``name`` and extension ``.ext``
*    ``cd name``: Changes Directory to folder ``name``
*    ``cd ..``: Moves up one directory
*    ``cd``: Moves to root directory
*    ``ls``: Shows all files in directory
*    ``ls -l``: Shows all files in directory in detailed manner with read, write, and execute permissions.

| Get used to them. You'll be using them a lot.
