Theory Lecture 01
-----------------

| Week 1.
| The most relaxing class. We did introductions, learnt about the course, what absolutes are, what GCR to join, which books and software we need, and were also warned about how difficult it was gonna be but took it lightly. Don't make our mistake, young reader, this institution will break you unless you're prepared. At the time of writing this (1st October 2022), it already broke my colleagues. In the first Sessional of Calculus, the total marks were 60. Our class average was 24/60. The Highest in Section A was 36 and in Section C was 40. You must be ready.
