Programming Fundamentals
========================

| I don't want FAST to come after me and try to take this thing down so, none of their material will be uploaded here. I can however reference info from it, and upload and link files that don't belong to them.
| Programming Fundamenttals has 4 Total Credit Hours. 3 for Theory, and 1 for Lab. That means for 16 weeks, there will be 3 hours a week for Theory and 1 hour a week for Lab. Yes, we do three hours but that's beside the point. Credit Hours are counted weirdly.

| Softwares:

*    Ubuntu, version 20.04, installed via Dual Boot or Virtual Machine (They say it's not allowed but honestly a VM is better for most cases. It works perfectly fine and I use it. It's far far less of a hassle to install and takes less space)
