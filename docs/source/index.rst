FAST BS-CS Journal Documentation
================================

| This documentation is being written by students of the FAST Bachelor's of Computer Science Program. After witnessing what the institution meant in the powerpoint slides by '50% of students won't make it to the second year', my goal is to make a central hub where I note down all of my learnings in a clear, summarized, redistributable way such that anyone who needs them can use them. Hopefully in the future it will serve and help out more people, until a change is made so this degree doesn't have to be this difficult in the first place.

.. note::

   This project is under active development until the degree is completed. So I guess that means 2026.
