FAST BS-CS Journal Documentation
================================

| This documentation is being written by students of the FAST Bachelor of Computer Science Program. After witnessing what the institution meant in the PowerPoint slides by "50% of students won't make it to the second year", my goal is to make a central hub where I note down all of my learnings in a clear, summarized, redistributable way such that anyone who needs them can use them. Hopefully, it will serve and help out more people, until a change is made so this degree doesn't have to be this difficult in the first place.

| If you're a student from a new admission, here's some advice and general tips to know from the mistakes I've made, so you don't have to.

*    If you need to buy a new machine, get a laptop. If you don't have much money, get a used or refurbished laptop and put an SSD in it.
*    Buy a whiteboard so you can write down your weekly tasks and deadlines and then you can put it in the corner and wake up to it every day
*    Interact with people and find out more of who they are and what their skills are. You'll be surprised with the level of people that arrive to this institution from all sorts of places. Make sure you have someone you trust because the only thing standing between you and a bad grade is their ability to explain a concept to you (I still owe you for explaining the entire Islamic Studies syllabus to me 40 minutes before the sessional. If you're reading this, Thanks Zubair!).
*    You shouldn't worry, you shouldn't complain, and you shouldn't cry. The reason being, it doesn't help.

.. note::

   This project is under active development until the degree is completed. So I guess that means 2026.
