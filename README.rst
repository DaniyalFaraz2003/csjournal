Template for the Read the Docs tutorial
=======================================

This documentation is being written by a student of the FAST Bachelor's of Computer Science Program. After witnessing what the institution meant in the powerpoint slides by '40% of students won't make it', my goal is to make a central hub where I note down all of my learnings in a clear, summarized, redistributable way such that anyone who needs them can use them. Hopefully in the future it will serve and help out more people, until a change is made so this degree doesn't have to be this difficult in the first place.

This project is under active development and will receive constant updates. If what you're looking for isn't here at the moment, check back soon, or contact us on the (FAST Survival Discord Server).
